# Code Review Findings - Heap Implementation

## Date: 2025-06-29

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Object Property Access Bug** (arrays.ts:115, 188)
   - ARRAY_GET uses `index as string` which is unsafe
   - ARRAY_SET uses `index` instead of `index.value`
   - This breaks all object property operations
   - **Status**: Attempted fix but caused test failure - NEEDS PROPER PLANNING

2. **Stack Overflow Risk** (vm-manager.ts:446)
   - `restoreReferences` is recursive
   - Can exceed call stack for deeply nested structures
   - This is the exact issue we were trying to fix!
   - **Status**: NOT FIXED - needs iterative implementation

3. **Stack Underflow Risk** (arrays.ts multiple locations)
   - Uses `state.stack.pop()!` without checking
   - Can crash VM with malformed bytecode
   - **Status**: NOT FIXED

4. **Inefficient Serialization** (vm-manager.ts:410)
   - Uses JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for each heap object
   - Performance issue for large heaps
   - **Status**: Works but inefficient

### What We Successfully Fixed

1. ✅ Safe heap serialization (no stack overflow on CC)
2. ✅ Invalid heap access returns undefined (no crash)
3. ✅ Array/Object literals create heap references
4. ✅ Undefined handling is consistent
5. ✅ Added TODO for future ELEMENT_GET/SET refactoring

### Next Steps Required

1. **DO NOT** make hasty fixes to object property access
2. **PLAN** proper solution for ARRAY_GET/SET with objects
3. **CONSIDER** the future Map support mentioned by user
4. **TEST** thoroughly before implementing

### Important Note

The ARRAY_GET/SET handling of objects is a complex architectural issue that needs careful planning, not quick fixes. The user specifically warned about this complexity.
