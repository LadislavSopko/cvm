        "PROJECT STRUCTURE: This is an Nx monorepo with packages: @cvm/parser (compiles TS to bytecode), @cvm/types (CVMValue type system), @cvm/vm (executes bytecode), @cvm/mcp-server (MCP integration), @cvm/storage (state persistence). " +
        "CURRENT MISSION: Fix critical architectural flaws identified in comprehensive analysis. The [] accessor system is fundamentally broken - obj[123] fails, array['0'] doesn't work like JavaScript, and the compiler emits wrong opcodes. " +
