# Active Context - CVM Project

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Ready for Mission-Critical Features** - Architecture complete, focus on Claude's needs!

## Key Realizations (June 23, 2025)
1. **fs.readFile() is NOT needed!** Claude has direct file access via Read tool
2. **State persistence already solid** - CVM waits indefinitely for CC responses
3. **Focus on smarter CC/CVM interaction**, not crash recovery

## Just Completed ‚úÖ

### üîç Execution Management Tools (DONE - June 23, 2025)
**Implemented all planned features**:
- `cvm_list_executions()` - Lists all executions with current marked
- `cvm_get_execution(id?)` - Detailed info (uses current if no ID)
- `cvm_set_current(id)` - Sets default execution
- `cvm_delete_execution(id)` - Requires confirmation token

**Enhancements**:
- `cvm_start()` auto-sets new execution as current (unless setCurrent: false)
- `cvm_getTask()`, `cvm_submitTask()`, `cvm_status()` - All work without executionId
- Full test coverage (26 tests passing)

## What to Build Next (Updated Priority Order)

### 2. üîÑ Array Methods: map/filter/reduce (HIGH - 2-3 days)
**Why**: Essential for file list processing
```typescript
files.filter(f => f.endsWith('.ts')).map(f => CC("Analyze: " + f));
```

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling: try/catch (MEDIUM - 3-4 days)
**Why**: Graceful failure handling
```typescript
try {
  const result = CC("Process: " + file);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Skipped: " + file);
}
```

### Note: Task Metadata Postponed
After testing, keeping `getTask` simple (returns just prompt string) is the right design. Execution info available via `cvm_get_execution()`.

See memory-bank/priorities.md for complete analysis.

## Architecture Summary

### What CVM Is
- **Passive Task Engine**: Never pushes, only responds to Claude's queries
- **State Holder**: Maintains variables/position between CC() calls
- **Task Creator**: CC() creates TODOs for Claude

### What CVM Is NOT
- NOT a general programming language
- NOT for complex algorithms
- NOT for building applications

### VM Architecture (Complete ‚úÖ)
- **Handler Pattern**: All 51 opcodes use modular handlers
- **State Management**: Variables, stack, PC, iterators
- **Persistence**: Full state serialization for CC/FS operations
- **Type System**: Matches JavaScript semantics

## Technical Context
- **Published**: cvm-server v0.9.2 on npm
- **Test Coverage**: 594 tests (319 VM + 275 other)
- **Language Features**: See docs/API.md for complete reference
- **Sandbox Security**: CVM_SANDBOX_PATHS environment variable

## Key Files
- `/packages/vm/src/lib/handlers/` - All opcode implementations
- `/packages/parser/src/lib/compiler.ts` - AST ‚Üí bytecode compiler
- `/packages/mcp-server/` - MCP interface for Claude
- `/test/examples/` - Usage examples

## Mission Reminder
Every feature must answer: **"Does this help Claude process many tasks systematically?"**

If it doesn't help with task orchestration ‚Üí we don't build it.
