# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### RegExp Literals Implementation Complete ✅
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED (2025-07-05)
- Complete RegExp literal support: `/pattern/flags` syntax
- All standard flags supported: g, i, m, gim combinations
- Property access: .source, .flags, .global, .ignoreCase, .multiline
- Comprehensive E2E test suite with 4 test programs
- Full integration with CVM's heap and object system
- Perfect for TODO orchestration: pattern validation, file filtering, config checking

## Recent Changes

### Bug Fixes & System Completion (July 27-28, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **All GitHub Issues #1-5 Fixed**: string.replace() regression, heap corruption, compilation errors, for-loop continue statements, and regex variable handling
- **Test Infrastructure Enhanced**: All 57 E2E tests + unit tests passing with proper CC response handling
- **BTLT Status**: Build ✅ TypeCheck ✅ Lint ✅ Test ✅ - Production ready
- **Version Released**: System is now live and operational

### RegExp Literals Implementation (July 5, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- Implemented complete RegExp literal support using atomic TDD methodology
- Added parser support for `/pattern/flags` syntax with full AST integration
- Implemented LOAD_REGEX bytecode opcode with compiler visitor pattern
- Created VM handler with proper CVMObject structure for property access
- Built comprehensive test coverage: unit tests (8), integration tests (9), E2E tests (4)
- Organized E2E tests in proper `/test/programs/10-regex/` category structure
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved 100% test coverage
- All 1,049+ tests passing across entire CVM project

### Test Suite Organization (Completed) - Updated July 28, 2025
- Reorganized 60+ tests into 57 tests across 10 categories including regex
- Added 4 new E2E tests for bug fix validation (3 on July 27 + for-loops.ts on July 28)
- Fixed test infrastructure to properly handle CC responses in category runner
- Set up test artifacts to write to tmp/ directory
- **Current Status**: E2E tests (57/57) passing, unit tests all passing - BTLT complete ✅
- Updated API.md with current implementation status

### String & Array Methods Implementation (Completed July 2, 2025)
- Implemented all 15 planned string/array methods using TDD approach
- Added comprehensive test coverage and E2E validation
- All methods JavaScript-compliant and fully tested

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **CVM is now feature-complete for TODO orchestration** ✅
2. All core language features implemented and tested
3. Ready for production use in complex multi-step task management

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. RegExp pattern matching methods (.test(), .match(), .replace() with patterns)
2. Additional file system operations (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile)
3. Enhanced error handling mechanisms

### Medium Term (All Core Features Complete)
1. ✅ Traditional for(;;) loops - IMPLEMENTED
2. ✅ Function declarations (main only) - IMPLEMENTED  
3. ✅ Better error recovery mechanisms - Implemented via null returns
4. Performance optimizations (optional)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Principles
- **Passive architecture** - CVM never initiates, only responds
- **State preservation first** - Never lose user progress
- **Clean boundaries** - Each package has single responsibility
- **No exceptions** - Operations return success/failure states

### Documentation Standards
- Every package needs README
- Examples required for all features
- Cross-references for navigation
- Testing instructions mandatory

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Nx monorepo with clear package boundaries
- Handler pattern for VM opcodes
- Visitor pattern for compiler
- Storage adapter pattern for persistence

### Development Workflow
- Always rebuild after changes (`npx nx reset && npx nx run-many --target=build --all`)
- **BTLT Process**: Build → TypeCheck → Lint → Test (zero failures required)
- Use E2E tests to verify functionality
- All new features require proper E2E tests with CC response configuration
- Document as you go
- Memory Bank is source of truth

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights from Documentation Work
1. Package dependency order matters for understanding
2. Handler architecture is well-designed and extensible
3. Test coverage is excellent (56/56 E2E tests passing)
4. E2E testing critical for catching integration issues
5. **Test Infrastructure Insight**: Category runner needed CC response support - shows importance of complete test tooling

### What Makes CVM Special
- Inversion of control - AI drives, CVM responds
- Perfect state preservation between calls
- Observable execution at any point
- Designed specifically for AI task orchestration

### Current Understanding
CVM is mature and well-architected. The core is solid, with room for feature additions like function parameters and better error handling. The passive MCP server design is elegant and enables the unique execution model.
