# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Documentation Overhaul Completed
Just finished comprehensive documentation update:
- Created detailed READMEs for all packages (parser, types, storage, vm, mcp-server, mongodb)
- Created README for cvm-server app
- Updated ARCHITECTURE_UNDERSTANDING.md with project overview
- Updated CVM_EXECUTION_MODEL.md for accuracy
- Updated INTEGRATION_TESTING.md for E2E testing
- Updated HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md with current implementation

### Memory Bank Reorganization
Currently rebuilding Memory Bank from scratch to follow proper structure per README.md.

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Improvements
- Each package now has comprehensive README with architecture, usage, and examples
- Cross-references between documents for easy navigation
- Clear dependency hierarchy documented
- Testing instructions included everywhere

### Architecture Clarifications
- Emphasized CVM's passive nature throughout docs
- Clarified CC() as "Cognitive Checkpoint" not "call"
- Updated MCP tool references to match actual implementation
- Added practical examples and common patterns

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ~~Complete Memory Bank core files~~ âœ“ (completed)
2. Review and clean up test programs in /home/laco/cvm/test/programs
3. Ensure all cross-references are valid
4. Verify documentation accuracy against code

### Short Term
1. Create integration test README
2. Update main project README if needed
3. Add examples directory with documented samples

### Medium Term
1. Function parameters support
2. Traditional for(;;) loops
3. Better error recovery mechanisms
4. Performance optimizations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Principles
- **Passive architecture** - CVM never initiates, only responds
- **State preservation first** - Never lose user progress
- **Clean boundaries** - Each package has single responsibility
- **No exceptions** - Operations return success/failure states

### Documentation Standards
- Every package needs README
- Examples required for all features
- Cross-references for navigation
- Testing instructions mandatory

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Nx monorepo with clear package boundaries
- Handler pattern for VM opcodes
- Visitor pattern for compiler
- Storage adapter pattern for persistence

### Development Workflow
- Always rebuild after changes (`npx nx reset && npx nx run-many --target=build --all`)
- Use E2E tests to verify functionality
- Document as you go
- Memory Bank is source of truth

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights from Documentation Work
1. Package dependency order matters for understanding
2. Handler architecture is well-designed and extensible
3. Test coverage is good (83%+ in core packages)
4. E2E testing critical for catching integration issues

### What Makes CVM Special
- Inversion of control - AI drives, CVM responds
- Perfect state preservation between calls
- Observable execution at any point
- Designed specifically for AI task orchestration

### Current Understanding
CVM is mature and well-architected. The core is solid, with room for feature additions like function parameters and better error handling. The passive MCP server design is elegant and enables the unique execution model.
