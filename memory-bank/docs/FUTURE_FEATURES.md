# Future Features - CVM Roadmap

Based on zen's excellent analysis and suggestions for CVM evolution.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Structured I/O for CC()
- **Current**: Simple string in/out: `CC("What is your name?")`
- **Future**: Structured JSON objects for richer context
- **Tool Use**: Support for function calling patterns (similar to OpenAI's schema)
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  const result = CC({
    prompt: "Analyze this data",
    context: { data: [...] },
    tools: ["search", "calculate"]
  });
  ```

### 2. Error Handling for Cognitive Faults
- Handle AI refusals/failures gracefully
- Define behavior for:
  - API errors (429, 500, etc.)
  - Malformed responses
  - Refusals to answer
- Options: Exceptions, error objects, retry strategies

### 3. Resource Management ("Gas" System)
- Credits/gas concept to prevent runaway costs
- Each CC() consumes credits
- VM instance initialized with credit budget
- Automatic halt when credits exhausted
- Per-instruction cost tracking

### 4. Observability & Debugging
- CVM Tracer/Debugger tool
- Visualize execution flow
- Inspect stack/memory at any point
- Full prompt/response history for CC() calls
- Step-through debugging support

### 5. Concurrency Model
- Async/await support for non-blocking operations
- Allow parallel CC() calls where appropriate
- Non-blocking external API calls
- Efficient resource utilization

## Safety Features (Immediate Priority)

### getTask Loop Protection
- Counter for consecutive getTask calls without submitTask
- Configurable limit (e.g., 10 attempts)
- Automatic execution failure when limit exceeded
- Prevents infinite polling loops
- Clear error message: "Execution failed: Too many getTask calls without progress"

## Language Evolution

### Phase 1: Control Flow
- if/else statements
- Basic boolean operations
- Comparison operators

### Phase 2: Loops
- while loops with safety limits
- for loops
- break/continue statements

### Phase 3: Functions
- Function definitions
- Function calls
- Local scopes
- Return values from functions

### Phase 4: Data Structures
- Arrays
- Objects/Maps
- String manipulation
- JSON parsing/serialization

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Try/catch error handling
- Modules/imports
- Type annotations
- Pattern matching

## Platform Features

### 1. Multi-Model Support
