# Critical Missing Features in CVM

## Discovered During Integration Testing

### 1. string.length - CRITICAL
- **Issue**: Cannot get length of strings AT ALL
- **Impact**: Makes string validation impossible (passwords, input validation)
- **Example that fails**: `let len = password.length;`
- **Current workaround**: None - feature completely missing

### 2. undefined value - CRITICAL  
- **Issue**: No `undefined` type or keyword
- **Impact**: Cannot check for missing values, breaks common JS patterns
- **Example that fails**: `if (x === undefined)`
- **Current workaround**: Use `null` instead

### 3. String Methods - IMPORTANT
- **Missing**: substring, indexOf, charAt, split, trim, etc.
- **Impact**: No string manipulation possible
- **Example use cases**: 
  - Validate email format
  - Extract parts of strings
  - Clean user input

## Why These Matter

These aren't nice-to-have features - they're FUNDAMENTAL for any real programming:
- How do you validate a password without checking its length?
- How do you check if a variable was initialized without undefined?
- How do you process text without string methods?

## Implementation Priority

1. **string.length** - Add STRING_LEN opcode similar to ARRAY_LEN
2. **undefined** - Add as a proper value type in the VM
3. **Basic string methods** - Start with substring and indexOf

Without these, CVM is severely limited for real-world use cases.
