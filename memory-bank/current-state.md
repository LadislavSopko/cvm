# Current State

## What's Working

### Core VM Features
- ✅ Complete bytecode interpreter with stack-based execution
- ✅ State persistence across CC() calls
- ✅ Full MCP integration with all tools exposed
- ✅ Heap management for arrays and objects
- ✅ File system operations (sandboxed)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

### Language Support
- ✅ All basic control flow (if/else, while, for...of)
- ✅ Variables with proper scoping
- ✅ Arrays with methods (push, length, indexing)
- ✅ Objects with property access
- ✅ String methods and operations
- ✅ JSON parsing and stringification
- ✅ Type checking and conversion

### Execution Management
- ✅ Program loading from source or file
- ✅ Multiple concurrent executions
- ✅ Current execution context
- ✅ Status inspection at any time
- ✅ Error handling with state preservation

## Recent Changes

### Latest Updates (Based on Git)
- Fixed compiler error handling consistency
- Comprehensive documentation updates
- Integration test suite implementation
- Unified GET/SET design for property access
- Array methods implementation without function support
- Updated ARCHITECTURE_UNDERSTANDING.md to reflect actual implementation

### Architecture Evolution
- Moved from direct VM calls to VM Manager abstraction
- Implemented proper heap for reference types
- Added storage adapter pattern (file/MongoDB)
- Simplified MCP tool interface
- Visitor pattern for compiler (statements and expressions)
- Handler pattern for VM opcodes

## Known Issues

### Language Limitations
- No support for regular for(;;) loops
- Functions cannot take parameters
- No try/catch error handling
- No async/await (by design - use CC instead)
- No module system

### Edge Cases
- Large arrays/objects may impact performance
- Deep recursion not well tested
- Some string methods may have incomplete Unicode support

## Next Development Areas

### Immediate Priority: Test Coverage Improvements
1. **heap-helpers.ts** - 0% coverage, critical gap
2. **unified.ts GET/SET** - 44% coverage for core operations  
3. **Storage resilience** - 59% coverage needs error handling tests

See `test-improvement-plan.md` for detailed TDD approach.

### Feature Development (After Test Coverage)
1. **Function Parameters**: Allow functions to accept arguments
2. **For Loops**: Traditional for(;;) loop support
3. **Error Recovery**: Better error messages and recovery options
4. **Performance**: Optimize bytecode execution for large programs
5. **Debugging**: Step-through debugging capabilities

### Infrastructure
1. **Better Testing**: Following TDD plan to reach 85%+ coverage
2. **Documentation**: More examples and tutorials
3. **Tooling**: VSCode extension for CVM development
4. **Monitoring**: Better execution metrics and logging

## Current Branch Status

Working on `global-evolution` branch:
- ✅ Completed 20-step evolution plan
- ✅ All tests passing (466 tests across 60 test files)
- ✅ Architecture documentation updated to match reality
- Ready for next phase of development

## Usage Patterns Emerging

1. **File Processing Pipelines**: Most common use case
2. **Interactive Workflows**: Guided data collection
3. **Report Generation**: Multi-source aggregation
4. **Code Analysis**: Systematic codebase exploration

## Performance Characteristics

- Small programs: Near-instant execution
- CC() pause/resume: Milliseconds
- State serialization: Scales with heap size
- Memory usage: Proportional to variables + heap

## Stability Assessment

The core VM is stable and well-tested. Edge cases exist around:
- Very large data structures
- Complex nested operations
- Unusual execution patterns

Overall: Production-ready for intended use cases.

## Project Structure Summary

- **Nx Monorepo** with clean package separation:
  - `@cvm/parser` - Parsing, validation, and compilation
  - `@cvm/vm` - VM execution engine and manager
  - `@cvm/types` - Shared type definitions
  - `@cvm/storage` - Storage abstraction (file/MongoDB)
  - `@cvm/mcp-server` - MCP protocol interface
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Memory Bank + technical docs in sync with code
