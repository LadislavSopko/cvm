# Progress Tracking

## What Works ✅

- **Data Import**: COMPLETE - 1201 ipotesis with 1341 embedded sanctions (1333 unique)
- **Qdrant Import**: COMPLETE - All 1333 unique sanctions fully indexed with field separation
- **Search UI**: Fully operational at http://localhost:3000
  - New detail.html page shows raw MongoDB data
  - Browser history preserves search results when navigating back
  - Clean separation between search results and detail views
- **MCP Integration**: Claude can search sanctions via MCP server
- **Documentation**: All projects have accurate READMEs
- **All Libraries/Apps Fixed**:
  - **mongo-importer**: ✅ All build/test/typecheck pass
  - **qdrant-client**: ✅ All build/test/lint commands pass
  - **qdrant-importer**: ✅ Fixed with parallel import working (~6-7 sanctions/second)
  - **search-api**: ✅ Fixed imports and detail view
  - **mcp-server-qdrant-openai**: ✅ Working with Claude

## Dify Knowledge Base Integration ✅

### What's Complete
- **sanctions_kb_v2 Collection**: Created with 1333 sanctions
- **RTF to DOCX Conversion**: All sanctions converted successfully
- **Dynamic Upload Scripts**: Auto-detect metadata field IDs from Dify API
- **Parallel Upload**: 5 instances processing 50 documents each
- **Metadata Fields**: ref_id, nrecord, title, rif_norm properly mapped
- **Parent-Child Chunking**: Full doc as parent, paragraphs as children (1500 tokens)

### Upload Status
- Successfully uploaded to Dify knowledge base
- All documents include metadata for enhanced search
- Processing complete with parallel upload script

## Key Metrics

- Ipotesis: 1201 documents ✅
- Sanctions: 1341 total (1333 unique) ✅
- sanctions_kb_v2: 1333 documents ✅
- DOCX files: 1333 converted ✅
- Dify upload: Complete with metadata ✅
- Qdrant vectors: 1333 embeddings ✅
- Fields indexed: title, mdText, verbale, 4 note types ✅
- Search weights: title 30%, verbale 30%, mdText 20%, notes varying ✅
- Import performance: ~6-7 sanctions/second with parallel processing ✅

## Scripts Organization

### Essential Scripts (kept in src/scripts/)
- check-status.ts - Check upload status
- convert-rtf-to-docx-fast.ts - RTF to DOCX conversion
- create-sanctions-kb-v2-collection.ts - Create KB collection
- enrich-ipotesis.ts - Enrich data
- import-all-ipotesis.ts - Import from XML
- populate-sanctions-kb-v2.ts - Populate KB
- reset-sanctions-kb-v2.ts - Reset upload status
- upload-to-dify-v2-dynamic.ts - Upload with dynamic metadata
- upload-to-dify-v2-parallel-dynamic.ts - Parallel upload

### Moved to tmp (test/old scripts)
- All test-*.ts files
- Old upload scripts without dynamic metadata
- Unused conversion scripts

## Next Major Milestone

1. **Immediate**: ✅ COMPLETE - Dify integration working
2. **AI Pipeline Manager v3**: Transform sanctions into flowcharts
   - ✅ Dify deployed and connected to MongoDB data
   - Create Angular Legal Editor for professional validation
   - Build flowchart generation workflows
   - Keep current system as debug/development tools

### Current Status
- Dify knowledge base populated with all sanctions
- Ready for AI-powered analysis and flowchart generation
- Dynamic metadata system ensures easy KB recreation
