# Progress - CVM Project Status

## What Works
- ✅ Core platform fully functional with 212 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 1 language extensions (Arrays + JSON parsing)
- ✅ Phase 2 language extensions (Branching - if/else, while, comparisons, arithmetic)
- ✅ Phase 3 VM implementation (ITER_START, ITER_NEXT, ITER_END opcodes)
- ✅ ARRAY_SET opcode - arrays fully functional with assignments
- ✅ Fixed arithmetic operations - proper numeric addition
- ✅ Storage abstraction with MongoDB and File adapters
- ✅ Published to npm as cvm-server v0.2.7
- ✅ Multiple CC support working correctly
- ✅ Full control flow with proper jump backpatching
- ✅ Smart ADD/CONCAT detection with recursive string literal checking
- ✅ Integration tests validating all features E2E
- ✅ Iterator stack management with nested loop support
- ✅ Array snapshot behavior for safe iteration
- ✅ ALL comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, ===, !==)
- ✅ ALL arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- ✅ ALL logical operators (&&, ||, !) with full compiler support
- ✅ Universal LENGTH opcode for both strings and arrays
- ✅ Return from main() - programs can produce results
- ✅ Integration tests to catch build/dependency issues
- ✅ Undefined value type with full JavaScript semantics
- ✅ Basic string methods (substring, indexOf, split)

## What's Left to Build

### CRITICAL GAPS (Discovered during testing)
- ✅ **string.length** - FIXED with universal LENGTH opcode!
- ✅ **undefined type** - FIXED with CVMUndefined and PUSH_UNDEFINED!
- ✅ **String operations** - FIXED with substring, indexOf, split!

### Language Extensions
- [x] **Phase 2: Branching** ✅ COMPLETE!
  - ✅ Opcodes (EQ, NEQ, LT, GT, JUMP, JUMP_IF_FALSE)
  - ✅ VM implementation with full test coverage
  - ✅ cvmToNumber helper for numeric conversions
  - ✅ CompilerState class with context stack
  - ✅ Compiler refactored to use CompilerState
  - ✅ Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >)
  - ✅ Arithmetic operators (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
  - ✅ If/else statements with proper backpatching
  - ✅ While loops with context management
  - ✅ Assignment expressions
  - ✅ E2E validation complete
- [ ] **Phase 3: Iteration** (IN PROGRESS)
  - ✅ Opcodes defined (ITER_START, ITER_NEXT, ITER_END, BREAK, CONTINUE)
  - ✅ VM implementation complete with comprehensive tests
  - ✅ Iterator state management with stack-based approach
  - ✅ Support for nested iterators (max depth: 10)
  - ✅ Array snapshot behavior (modifications don't affect iteration)
  - Need: foreach syntax in parser
  - Need: Compiler support for foreach loops
  - Need: Break/continue compilation
- [ ] **Phase 4: File Operations**
  - Opcode defined (FS_LIST_FILES)
  - Need: Implementation with path sandboxing

### Future Features
- ✅ Return values from main() - IMPLEMENTED!
- Function definitions
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations

## Current Status
**Phase**: Phase 3 IN PROGRESS - VM implementation complete, need parser/compiler
**Architecture**: Clean separation, all components integrated
**Testing**: 381 tests passing (38 test files)
**Integration Testing**: Full E2E testing via MCP in test/integration/
**Next Priority**: Unary operators, then compound assignments

### Recently Completed
- ✅ STRING METHODS - substring, indexOf, split with full JavaScript semantics
- ✅ Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- ✅ STRING LENGTH - Critical fix with universal LENGTH opcode
- ✅ UNDEFINED TYPE - Full JavaScript semantics implementation
- ✅ Integration test infrastructure with MCP client
- ✅ Return from main() with proper value propagation
- ✅ VM+Compiler integration tests to prevent stale builds

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Context stack** for jump resolution (supports nesting)
2. **JavaScript-like semantics** for comparisons
3. **Single-pass compilation** with backpatching
4. **TypeScript ES modules** with .js imports
5. **STRICT TDD** - no code without tests
6. **Iterator stack** for nested foreach support
7. **Two-value ITER_NEXT** push (element, hasMore) for efficiency
8. **Array snapshots** to prevent iteration corruption

## Phase 3 Next Steps
1. ✅ Design iterator state management in VM
2. ✅ Implement ITER_START opcode (initialize iterator)
3. ✅ Implement ITER_NEXT opcode (advance iterator)
4. ✅ Implement ITER_END opcode (cleanup iterator)
5. Add foreach syntax to parser
6. Extend CompilerState for loop contexts (break/continue)
7. Implement compiler foreach generation
8. Integration test with real foreach syntax
