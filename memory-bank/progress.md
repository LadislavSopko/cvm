# Progress - CVM Project Status

## What Works
- ✅ NX workspace initialized
- ✅ Memory Bank structure created
- ✅ Project documentation complete
- ✅ Clear architecture defined
- ✅ TypeScript/NX configuration ready

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [ ] Create NX library structure
  - [ ] @cvm/parser library
  - [ ] @cvm/vm library
  - [ ] @cvm/mcp-server library
  - [ ] @cvm/mongodb library
- [ ] Set up MongoDB with Docker
- [ ] Implement basic types/interfaces

### Phase 2: Minimal Language Implementation
- [ ] Parser for v1 syntax (let, CC, print)
- [ ] Bytecode compiler
- [ ] Stack-based VM executor
- [ ] MongoDB state persistence
- [ ] Basic error handling

### Phase 3: MCP Integration
- [ ] MCP server implementation
- [ ] JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol handler
- [ ] Method implementations:
  - [ ] loadProgram
  - [ ] startExecution
  - [ ] getNext
  - [ ] reportCCResult
  - [ ] getExecutionState

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Example programs
- [ ] Claude integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 5: Language Expansion
- [ ] Control flow (if/else)
- [ ] Loops (while, foreach)
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Collections (arrays, maps)
- [ ] Type system improvements

## Current Status
**Phase**: 1 - Core Infrastructure
**Status**: Just started - Memory Bank created, ready to build libraries

## Known Issues
- None yet - project just beginning

## Technical Decisions

### Confirmed Decisions
1. **Stack-based VM**: Simpler than register-based
2. **String-only values**: Initially, add types later
3. **MongoDB persistence**: Every state change saved
4. **MCP protocol**: Standard communication with AI
5. **TypeScript with ES modules**: Use .js imports
6. **STRICT TDD**: No code without tests, build→lint→test after every change
7. **NX exclusively**: All commands via nx, no npm run scripts

### Pending Decisions
1. Error recovery strategies
2. Performance optimization approach
3. Security sandbox implementation
4. Multi-tenant support (future)

## Evolution Notes

### Architecture Evolution
- Started with understanding of CVM as "AI calling out"
- Evolved to "Claude polling CVM for work"
- This inversion makes the architecture much cleaner

### Language Evolution Plan
1. **v1**: Minimal - just variables, CC(), print
2. **v2**: Control flow - if/else
3. **v3**: Loops - while, foreach  
4. **v4**: Functions - modular code
5. **v5**: Collections - arrays, maps

### Future Considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Distributed execution
- Multiple AI agent support
- Visual debugging tools
- IDE integration

## Development Log

### 2024-01-13
- Project initialized
- NX workspace created
- Memory Bank documentation written
- Architecture clarified: CVM is deterministic server, Claude polls for work
- Cleaned up inconsistencies:
  - Standardized testing framework: Vitest
  - Standardized MCP method: cvm/getNext (not continueExecution)
  - Removed old project references from Memory Bank
- Ready to start implementation

## Next Session Focus
Start building the core NX libraries and basic type definitions for the CVM system.
