# Progress

## What Works

### Core Language Features ‚úÖ
- **Variables & Types**: All primitive types, arrays, objects
- **Control Flow**: if/else, while, for...of loops
- **Operators**: All arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
- **Functions**: Function declarations (without parameters)
- **Strings**: Basic methods (slice, split, charAt, indexOf, substring)
- **Arrays**: push, length, indexing, for...of iteration
- **Objects**: Property access, nested objects
- **Type Operations**: typeof, toString conversions
- **JSON**: parse and stringify

### VM Capabilities ‚úÖ
- **Bytecode Execution**: 80+ opcodes implemented
- **State Persistence**: Complete state saved/restored
- **Heap Management**: Proper reference semantics
- **CC() Integration**: Pause/resume for cognitive tasks
- **File Operations**: Sandboxed fs.listFiles()
- **Console Output**: console.log() support

### Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **MCP Server**: All tools exposed and working
- **Storage**: File and MongoDB backends
- **Testing**: 83%+ coverage on core packages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs
- **E2E Testing**: Full integration test suite
- **NPM Package**: Published and installable

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Priority - Code Cleanup üßπ
1. **Review all test programs in /home/laco/cvm/test/programs**
   - Audit existing test programs for relevance and quality
   - Remove outdated or redundant tests
   - Ensure tests align with CVM's mission as TODO orchestrator
   - Document what each test validates
   - Clean up any legacy code patterns

### Must Have Features (Core TODO Orchestration) üéØ
1. **`string.endsWith()`** - Essential for file type detection
   ```typescript
   if (file.endsWith(".ts")) {
     CC("Analyze TypeScript file: " + file);
   }
   ```

2. **`string.includes()`** - Path pattern matching
   ```typescript
   if (filename.includes("test")) {
     CC("This is a test file - analyze for test patterns");
   }
   ```

3. **`array.slice()`** - Process files in batches
   ```typescript
   const batch = files.slice(0, 10);
   for (const file of batch) {
     CC("Process file: " + file);
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling Design** - All operations return null/undefined on error
   ```typescript
   const content = fs.readFile(path);  // Returns null if file doesn't exist
   if (content === null) {
     CC("File not found: " + path + " - how should I proceed?");
   }
   ```

### Nice to Have Features (Quality of Life) üîß
1. **`string.startsWith()`** - Directory filtering
2. **Switch statements** - Cleaner task routing
3. **`array.filter()` with simple predicates** - File list filtering
4. **`Object.keys()`** - When working with config objects
5. **Basic RegExp** - Validate CC() responses

### Infrastructure (Future) üèóÔ∏è
1. **CLI Tool** - Direct command-line usage
2. **VSCode Extension** - Syntax highlighting
3. **Web Playground** - Try CVM in browser
4. **Better Examples** - Real-world TODO orchestration cases

## Current Status

### Mission Achieved ‚úÖ
- CVM successfully serves as an algorithmic TODO manager
- Claude can process complex multi-step tasks without losing context
- State persistence ensures perfect execution flow across 1000s of operations
- The passive architecture (Claude asks "what's next?") works beautifully

### Design Principles Established ‚úÖ
- **Operations never throw** - They return null/undefined on error
- **Simplicity over features** - CVM is a TODO list, not a programming language
- **Mission-focused** - Every feature must help orchestrate tasks for Claude

## Features NOT Needed (Against Mission) ‚ùå

### Complex Computation
- Advanced math operations
- Complex data transformations
- General-purpose programming constructs

### Over-Engineering
- Classes/OOP
- Async/Promises (CVM is synchronous by design)
- Type annotations
- Try-catch blocks (use null returns instead)
- Template literals (concatenation works fine)

### General Purpose Features
- Map/Set collections
- Advanced array methods (flatMap, reduce)
- Function parameters (adds complexity without TODO benefit)

## Success Metrics

### Achieved ‚úÖ
- Can orchestrate complex file analysis tasks
- Maintains perfect state across interruptions
- Simple enough for clear TODO-style programs
- Reliable error handling through null returns

### Next Phase üéØ
- Implement Must Have features for better TODO orchestration
- Create examples showing real-world file processing workflows
- Keep the language minimal and mission-focused

## Key Insight
CVM has achieved its core mission. The remaining features are refinements that make TODO orchestration smoother, not expansions toward general-purpose programming. The beauty is in what we DON'T add.
