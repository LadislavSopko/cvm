- **Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs
- **E2E Testing**: Full integration test suite
- **NPM Package**: Published and installable

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Priority - Code Cleanup üßπ
1. ~~**Review all test programs in /home/laco/cvm/test/programs**~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Organized into 9 categories
   - Removed 20+ redundant tests
   - All 42 tests passing
   - Test artifacts in tmp/

### String & Array Methods Implementation üöÄ
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-07-02) - All 15 methods implemented and tested!
- Implemented 15 string/array methods for CVM using TDD
- Added: string.includes, endsWith, startsWith, trim, trimStart, trimEnd, replace, replaceAll, lastIndexOf, repeat, padStart, padEnd, array.slice, join, indexOf
- All methods are JavaScript-compliant and tested
- 615+ tests passing across all packages
- Full E2E test coverage
- Fixed all TypeScript errors, builds clean
- No regressions in existing functionality

### New Language Features Implementation üöÄ
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-07-03) - 4 new features implemented using TDD!
- Implemented 4 new language features for CVM using TDD: Object.keys() method, traditional for(;;) loops, switch/case statements, for...in loops. All features are JavaScript-compliant and fully tested with unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- Added Object.keys() method returning array of object property names
- Implemented traditional for(;;) loops with C-style syntax (init; condition; increment)  
- Added switch/case statements with fall-through behavior and default case support
- Implemented for...in loops for object property iteration
- All implementations follow JavaScript semantics
- Comprehensive test coverage including E2E testing
- Updated API documentation to reflect supported features

### Must Have Features (Core TODO Orchestration) üéØ
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - All 15 methods implemented:**

**String Methods (12) ‚úÖ:**
- `includes()`, `endsWith()`, `startsWith()` - Pattern matching
- `trim()`, `trimStart()`, `trimEnd()` - Input cleaning  
- `replace()`, `replaceAll()` - Path normalization
- `lastIndexOf()`, `repeat()` - Utility operations
- `padStart()`, `padEnd()` - Formatting

**Array Methods (3) ‚úÖ:**
- `slice()` - Batch processing
- `join()` - Report generation
- `indexOf()` - Element searching

4. **Error Handling Design** - All operations return null/undefined on error
   ```typescript
   const content = fs.readFile(path);  // Returns null if file doesn't exist
   if (content === null) {
     CC("File not found: " + path + " - how should I proceed?");
   }
   ```

### Nice to Have Features (Quality of Life) üîß
1. ~~**`string.startsWith()`**~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Directory filtering
2. ~~**Switch statements**~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Cleaner task routing  
3. **`array.filter()` with simple predicates** - File list filtering
4. ~~**`Object.keys()`**~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED - When working with config objects
5. **Traditional for(;;) loops** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Better iteration control
6. **for...in loops** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Object property iteration
7. **Basic RegExp** - Validate CC() responses

### Infrastructure (Future) üèóÔ∏è
1. **CLI Tool** - Direct command-line usage
2. **VSCode Extension** - Syntax highlighting
3. **Web Playground** - Try CVM in browser
4. **Better Examples** - Real-world TODO orchestration cases

## Current Status

### Mission Achieved ‚úÖ
- CVM successfully serves as an algorithmic TODO manager
- Claude can process complex multi-step tasks without losing context
- State persistence ensures perfect execution flow across 1000s of operations
- The passive architecture (Claude asks "what's next?") works beautifully

### Design Principles Established ‚úÖ
- **Operations never throw** - They return null/undefined on error
- **Simplicity over features** - CVM is a TODO list, not a programming language
- **Mission-focused** - Every feature must help orchestrate tasks for Claude

## Features NOT Needed (Against Mission) ‚ùå

### Complex Computation
- Advanced math operations
- Complex data transformations
- General-purpose programming constructs

### Over-Engineering
- Classes/OOP
- Async/Promises (CVM is synchronous by design)
- Type annotations
- Try-catch blocks (use null returns instead)
- Template literals (concatenation works fine)

### General Purpose Features
- Map/Set collections
- Advanced array methods (flatMap, reduce)
- Function parameters (adds complexity without TODO benefit)

## Success Metrics

### Achieved ‚úÖ
- Can orchestrate complex file analysis tasks
- Maintains perfect state across interruptions
- Simple enough for clear TODO-style programs
- Reliable error handling through null returns

### Next Phase üéØ
- Implement Must Have features for better TODO orchestration
- Create examples showing real-world file processing workflows
- Keep the language minimal and mission-focused

## Key Insight
CVM has achieved its core mission. The remaining features are refinements that make TODO orchestration smoother, not expansions toward general-purpose programming. The beauty is in what we DON'T add.
