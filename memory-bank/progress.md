# Progress Report

## Mission Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

CVM successfully serves as an algorithmic TODO manager for Claude, enabling complex multi-step task orchestration with state persistence.

## Core System ✅
- **Virtual Machine**: Stack-based execution with heap memory management
- **Bytecode Compiler**: AST → bytecode transformation with TypeScript parsing
- **State Persistence**: MongoDB integration for cross-session continuity
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol server for Claude integration
- **Testing**: 56/56 E2E tests passing + all unit/integration tests passing across entire project

## Language Features ✅
**Complete TODO orchestration feature set:**
- **Types**: string, number, boolean, null, undefined
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment
- **Control Flow**: if/else, while, for-of, switch/case, for(;;), for...in
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and Objects with full manipulation
- **Built-ins**: JSON, console.log, CC() cognitive calls
- **File System**: fs.readFile(), fs.writeFile(), fs.listFiles() with sandboxing
- **RegExp**: Complete pattern matching with .test(), .match(), .replace()

## RegExp Implementation ✅ (v0.15.0)
**Production-ready pattern matching for sophisticated workflows:**
- RegExp literals: `/pattern/flags` syntax
- Pattern testing: `regex.test(string)`
- Data extraction: `string.match(regex)`
- Text transformation: `string.replace(regex, replacement)`
- All flags: Global (g), case insensitive (i), multiline (m)
- Capture groups: $1, $2, $&, $$ replacement patterns
- JavaScript-compliant behavior with proper error handling

**Enables**: Log analysis, data validation, content sanitization, pattern-based filtering

## Design Principles ✅
- **Operations never throw** - Return null/undefined on error
- **Simplicity over features** - CVM is a TODO list, not a programming language
- **Mission-focused** - Every feature helps orchestrate tasks for Claude

## Features NOT Needed ❌
- Callback functions (array.filter() excluded for this reason)
- Classes/OOP, async/promises, try-catch blocks
- Multiple function definitions (main() is sufficient)
- Advanced math operations, complex data transformations

## Recent Bug Fixes & Validation (July 28, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue #5**: Fixed string.replace() regression - compiler was always emitting STRING_REPLACE_REGEX instead of STRING_REPLACE for non-regex arguments
  - **Validated with**: `05-strings/string-replace-comprehensive.ts` E2E test
- **Issue #3**: Fixed compilation error reporting - now shows readable error messages instead of [object Object]
  - **Validated with**: `01-basics/compilation-errors.ts` E2E test
- **Issue #2**: Fixed heap corruption bug - heap allocations were overwriting existing objects after deserialization because nextId was using a local variable instead of heap.nextId property
  - **Validated with**: `05-strings/string-split-heap-safety.ts` E2E test
- **Issue #1**: Fixed C-style for loops with continue - continue statements were jumping to loop start instead of update expression, causing infinite loops
  - **Root cause**: Missing test coverage - unit tests had empty placeholders for for-loop continue tests
  - **Solution**: Modified compiler to patch continue targets to update expression, not loop start
  - **Validated with**: `03-control-flow/for-loops.ts` comprehensive E2E test + filled unit tests
  - **Files Modified**: for-statement.ts, continue-statement.ts, while-statement.ts, for-of-statement.ts, for-in-statement.ts
  - **Tests Added**: 10 comprehensive for-loop tests in E2E + 6 unit tests in for-statement.spec.ts
- **Test Infrastructure Fixed**: Category runner now properly handles CC responses for all tests
- **BTLT Achievement**: All 57 E2E tests passing (added for-loops.ts) + all unit tests passing with zero failures
- **Regex Variable Bug Fixed**: Fixed critical issue where `string.replace(regexVariable, replacement)` was not working correctly by updating compiler and VM handler logic

## Current Status
**Mission Achieved** - CVM provides complete TODO orchestration capabilities. The passive architecture (Claude asks "what's next?") combined with state persistence enables infinite complexity through guided steps.

**Quality Assurance**: Recent bug fixes fully validated with comprehensive E2E test coverage. BTLT process ensures zero failures, zero warnings, zero shortcuts.

Ready for widespread production use with robust test infrastructure.
