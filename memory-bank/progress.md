- ✅ TypeScript/NX configuration ready
- ✅ Parser - Fully functional with TypeScript compiler API
- ✅ VM - Stack-based executor with VMManager encapsulation
- ✅ MongoDB - Complete persistence layer implementation
- ✅ Types - Shared type definitions package (@cvm/types)
- ✅ Integration - Parser-VM-MongoDB fully integrated and tested
- ✅ MCP Server - Fully implemented with all tests passing

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [x] Create NX library structure
  - [x] @cvm/parser library
  - [x] @cvm/vm library
  - [x] @cvm/mcp-server library (implementation done, tests need fixes)
  - [x] @cvm/mongodb library
  - [x] @cvm/types library (shared types)
- [x] Set up MongoDB with Docker (using existing instance)
- [x] Implement basic types/interfaces (bytecode types done)

### Phase 2: Minimal Language Implementation
- [x] Parser for TypeScript subset (using TS compiler API)
- [x] Bytecode compiler (transform AST to bytecode)
- [x] Stack-based VM executor
- [x] MongoDB state persistence (via VMManager)
- [x] Basic error handling

### Phase 3: MCP Integration
- [x] MCP server implementation (code complete)
- [x] JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol handler
- [x] Method implementations:
  - [x] loadProgram
  - [x] startExecution
  - [x] getNext
  - [x] reportCCResult
  - [x] getExecutionState
- [x] MCP server tests updated and passing

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [x] Unit tests for all components (45 tests passing)
- [x] Integration tests
- [ ] Example programs
- [ ] Claude integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 5: Language Expansion
- [ ] Control flow (if/else)
- [ ] Loops (while, foreach)
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Collections (arrays, maps)
- [ ] Type system improvements

## Current Status
**Phase**: 3 - MCP Integration
**Status**: Complete - All core components implemented and tested

## Known Issues
- None - all tests passing, architecture clean

## Technical Decisions

### Confirmed Decisions
1. **Stack-based VM**: Simpler than register-based
2. **String-only values**: Initially, add types later
3. **MongoDB persistence**: Every state change saved
4. **MCP protocol**: Standard communication with AI
5. **TypeScript with ES modules**: Use .js imports
6. **STRICT TDD**: No code without tests, build→lint→test after every change
7. **NX exclusively**: All commands via nx, no npm run scripts

### Pending Decisions
1. Error recovery strategies
2. Performance optimization approach
3. Security sandbox implementation
4. Multi-tenant support (future)

## Evolution Notes

### Architecture Evolution
- Started with understanding of CVM as "AI calling out"
- Evolved to "Claude polling CVM for work"
- This inversion makes the architecture much cleaner

### Language Evolution Plan
1. **v1**: Minimal - just variables, CC(), print
2. **v2**: Control flow - if/else
3. **v3**: Loops - while, foreach  
4. **v4**: Functions - modular code
5. **v5**: Collections - arrays, maps

### Future Considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Distributed execution
- Multiple AI agent support
- Visual debugging tools
- IDE integration

## Development Log

### 2024-01-13
- Project initialized
- NX workspace created
- Memory Bank documentation written
- Architecture clarified: CVM is deterministic server, Claude polls for work
- Cleaned up inconsistencies:
  - Standardized testing framework: Vitest
  - Standardized MCP method: cvm/getNext (not continueExecution)
  - Removed old project references from Memory Bank
- Implemented parser library:
  - Uses TypeScript compiler API for AST parsing
  - CVM as TypeScript subset (main() required)
  - Validates forbidden APIs (setTimeout, fetch, etc.)
  - Full TDD approach with all tests passing
- Added DISCLAIMER.md with copyright info
- Implemented compiler:
  - Transforms TypeScript AST to CVM bytecode
  - Minimal but functional: variables, CC(), console.log(), string concat
- Implemented VM library:
  - Stack-based bytecode executor with all basic opcodes
  - CC instruction pauses execution and allows resume
  - Integration tests prove end-to-end functionality
- Platform is now minimally functional!
- MongoDB setup:
  - Connected to existing MongoDB instance
  - Created CVM database with collections
- Implemented @cvm/mongodb library:
  - MongoDBAdapter for all database operations
  - Full TDD with 100% test coverage
  - Supports programs, executions, and history persistence
- Created @cvm/types package:
  - Solved circular dependency issues
  - Shared type definitions for all packages
  - Clean architectural separation
- Implemented VMManager pattern:
  - Encapsulates VM execution and persistence
  - VM owns MongoDB adapter instance
  - MCP server is now just a thin protocol layer
  - All business logic in VMManager
- Fixed architecture for proper separation of concerns:
  - Parser → VM → MongoDB (clean dependency chain)
  - MCP Server → VM (no direct MongoDB access)
  - All core components fully integrated
- MCP Server implementation complete:
  - All methods implemented with new architecture
  - Tests updated for VMManager pattern
  - All 13 MCP server tests passing
- **Platform fully functional**:
  - 45 total tests passing across all packages
  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Ready for example programs and AI integration

## Next Session Focus
Create example CVM programs to demonstrate full functionality. Test end-to-end integration with Claude AI. Consider adding more language features like control flow and loops.
