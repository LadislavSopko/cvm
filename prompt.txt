Continue with the refactored implementation plan. I need ALL the critical fixes that will make CVM reliable, not just the top 5. Include:

1. Error propagation through CC() boundaries
2. Array methods implementation without functions
3. Compound assignment fixes
4. Type coercion fixes
5. Better error messages with context
6. Any other CRITICAL fixes I missed

Remember: Exact code changes only - file, line, current vs fixed code. No timelines or estimates.
