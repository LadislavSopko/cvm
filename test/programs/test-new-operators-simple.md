# CVM New Operators Integration Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program is a focused integration test for newly implemented operators in the CVM including modulo (%), comparison operators (<=, >=), strict equality operators (===, !==), and logical operators (&&, ||, !). It validates each operator individually and then demonstrates their integration in practical scenarios including range checking, divisibility testing, and grade calculation with user input.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### Arithmetic Operators
- **Modulo operator (%)**: Tests remainder operations with various values

### Comparison Operators
- **Less than or equal (<=)**: Tests boundary and non-boundary cases
- **Greater than or equal (>=)**: Validates inclusive comparisons
- **Strict equality (===)**: Tests type-sensitive equality
- **Strict inequality (!==)**: Validates type-sensitive inequality

### Logical Operators
- **AND (&&)**: Boolean conjunction tests
- **OR (||)**: Boolean disjunction tests
- **NOT (!)**: Boolean negation tests

### Integration Features
- Range checking using combined operators
- Divisibility testing with modulo and logical operators
- Complex expressions with multiple operators
- Interactive grade calculation with CC input

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Direct Operator Testing Pattern
```typescript
console.log("17 % 5 = " + (17 % 5));
console.log("10 <= 10 = " + (10 <= 10));
```
Tests each operator with inline expressions for immediate verification.

### Type Comparison Pattern
```typescript
console.log("5 === 5 = " + (5 === 5));      // true
console.log("5 === '5' = " + (5 === "5"));  // false
```
Demonstrates strict equality's type sensitivity.

### Range Checking Pattern
```typescript
let inRange = num >= 10 && num <= 20;
```
Common pattern for inclusive range validation.

### Divisibility Pattern
```typescript
let divisible = (num % 3 === 0) || (num % 5 === 0);
```
Uses modulo with strict equality for divisibility checks.

### Complex Expression Pattern
```typescript
let complex = (a < 10 && b > 10) || !(a === b);
```
Combines multiple operators with proper precedence.

### Grade Calculation Pattern
```typescript
if (score >= 90) {
    grade = "A";
} else if (score >= 80) {
    grade = "B";
}
```
Cascading conditionals using new comparison operators.

### Compound Condition Pattern
```typescript
let honors = score >= 85 && passed;
```
Combines multiple criteria for eligibility checking.

### Organized Testing Pattern
The test is structured in sections:
1. Individual operator tests
2. Combined usage examples
3. User input integration
4. Summary of validated features

### Verification Checklist Pattern
```typescript
console.log("✓ Modulo (%)");
console.log("✓ Less/Greater than or equal (<=, >=)");
```
Provides clear confirmation of tested features.

This test is valuable because:
1. It validates all new operators work correctly
2. It shows operators integrate properly with existing features
3. It demonstrates practical usage patterns
4. It includes interactive testing with CC
5. It serves as a quick verification suite for operator functionality
