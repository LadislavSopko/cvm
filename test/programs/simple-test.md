# Simple Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary
This is a basic test program for the CVM that demonstrates the core cognitive capability of the virtual machine through the CC() (Cognitive Call) function. It showcases how the VM can pause execution to request AI-powered input and then resume with the response.

## 2. Key Functions/Features
- **main()**: Entry function that orchestrates a simple interactive flow
  - Announces program start
  - Makes a cognitive call to ask for a name
  - Greets the user with the received name
  - Confirms test completion
- **CC() Function**: The cognitive interrupt that requests AI processing
  - Takes a prompt string as input
  - Pauses VM execution until a response is provided
  - Returns the AI-generated response as a string
- **Self-invocation**: Immediately executes main() after definition

## 3. Code Patterns Used
- **Cognitive Interrupts**: Uses CC() to bridge deterministic code with AI reasoning
- **Interactive Flow**: Demonstrates request-response pattern with cognitive calls
- **String Concatenation**: Combines static greeting with dynamic AI response
- **Status Messages**: Provides clear execution flow with start/end messages
- **Const Variable**: Uses const for immutable binding of the cognitive response
- **Immediate Execution**: Function definition followed by direct invocation
