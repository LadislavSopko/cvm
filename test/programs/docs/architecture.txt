CVM Architecture Overview

The CVM consists of three main components:

1. Parser/Compiler
   - Converts TypeScript source code to bytecode
   - Implements visitor pattern for AST traversal
   - Generates stack-based instructions

2. Virtual Machine
   - Executes bytecode instructions
   - Manages execution state (stack, variables, PC)
   - Handles CC suspension and resumption

3. Storage Layer
   - Persists programs and execution states
   - Supports file-based and MongoDB storage
   - Manages output streams
