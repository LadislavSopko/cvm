# CVM For-of with fs.listFiles Test (No CC) Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program tests the integration of for-of loops with the CVM's fs.listFiles() function without cognitive calls (CC). It serves as a baseline test to ensure that for-of loops work correctly with file system operations before adding the complexity of CC interrupts. The program lists TypeScript files in a directory, iterates through them with a for-of loop, and simulates processing with a 5-file limit for testing purposes.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### File System Integration
- Uses fs.listFiles() to get directory contents
- Filters for TypeScript files using glob pattern "*.ts"
- Handles empty directory case gracefully

### For-of Loop Features
- Iterates over the files array returned by fs.listFiles()
- Maintains iteration count across loop executions
- Includes break statement for early termination

### Error Handling
- Checks for empty file list before processing
- Returns appropriate message when no files found
- Provides clear status messages throughout execution

### Testing Controls
- Limits processing to 5 files for test efficiency
- Simulates file processing without actual CC calls
- Returns completion status

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### File Listing Pattern
```typescript
let files = fs.listFiles("/home/laco/cvm/test/programs", {
    filter: "*.ts"
});
```
Demonstrates CVM's file system API with filtering options.

### Empty Check Pattern
```typescript
if (files.length === 0) {
    console.log("No TypeScript files found!");
    return "No files to analyze";
}
```
Handles edge case of no matching files gracefully.

### Progress Tracking Pattern
```typescript
let count = 0;
for (const filepath of files) {
    count = count + 1;
    console.log("\nProcessing file " + count + " of " + files.length + ": " + filepath);
}
```
Maintains external counter for progress reporting.

### Test Limitation Pattern
```typescript
if (count >= 5) {
    console.log("\nStopping at 5 files for testing");
    break;
}
```
Uses break statement to limit test scope while demonstrating loop control.

### Simulation Pattern
```typescript
// Just simulate processing without CC
console.log("Result: Simulated processing done");
```
Placeholder for CC calls, allowing testing of loop mechanics in isolation.

### Summary Report Pattern
```typescript
console.log("\n=== Analysis Complete ===");
console.log("Processed " + count + " files");
return "Analysis completed";
```
Provides execution summary and return value.

### Structured Output Pattern
The program uses section headers and consistent formatting to make test output easy to read and debug.

This test is valuable for:
1. Validating fs.listFiles() integration
2. Testing for-of loops with real file system data
3. Ensuring loop control statements (break) work correctly
4. Providing a baseline before adding CC complexity
