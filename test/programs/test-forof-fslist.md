# CVM For-of with fs.listFiles Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program is a minimal test case that validates the integration between for-of loops and the CVM's fs.listFiles() function. It demonstrates that for-of loops can successfully iterate over arrays returned by file system operations, with a focus on simplicity and core functionality testing. The test includes a break statement to limit iterations, making it a quick validation test.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### File System Integration
- Uses fs.listFiles() to retrieve directory contents
- Applies glob filter "test-*.ts" to get only test files
- Works with the actual file system, not simulated data

### For-of Loop Implementation
- Iterates over the files array using for-of syntax
- Maintains a counter variable across iterations
- Implements early exit with break statement

### Controlled Execution
- Limits processing to 3 files maximum
- Provides clear output for each iteration
- Returns completion status

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Filtered File Listing Pattern
```typescript
let files = fs.listFiles("/home/laco/cvm/test/programs", {
    filter: "test-*.ts"
});
```
Uses glob pattern to retrieve only test files, reducing dataset size.

### Simple Counter Pattern
```typescript
let count = 0;
for (const file of files) {
    count = count + 1;
    console.log("File " + count + ": " + file);
}
```
Basic iteration with manual counter for tracking progress.

### Early Exit Pattern
```typescript
if (count >= 3) {
    break;
}
```
Demonstrates break statement functionality while keeping test execution quick.

### Status Reporting Pattern
```typescript
console.log("Found " + files.length + " test files");
console.log("Iteration complete. Processed " + count + " files");
```
Provides before and after status for verification.

### Return Value Pattern
```typescript
return "Test complete";
```
Simple return statement confirming successful execution.

### Minimal Test Pattern
This test focuses on core functionality without additional complexity:
- No CC calls
- No nested loops
- No complex processing
- Clear, linear execution flow

This makes it an ideal initial test for validating that:
1. fs.listFiles() returns a proper array
2. for-of loops work with file system results
3. Basic loop control (break) functions correctly
4. The integration between CVM features is stable
