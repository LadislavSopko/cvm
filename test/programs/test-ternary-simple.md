# CVM Simple Ternary Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program is the absolute minimal test case for the ternary conditional operator (?:) in the CVM. It validates that the basic ternary syntax works with a literal boolean condition and string return values, serving as a fundamental verification that the ternary operator is implemented correctly.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### Ternary Operator Testing
- Tests condition ? trueValue : falseValue syntax
- Uses literal true as condition
- Returns string values based on condition
- Stores result in variable

### Minimal Implementation
- No complex expressions
- No nested operations
- Direct output of result
- Simplest possible test case

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Basic Ternary Pattern
```typescript
const result = true ? "yes" : "no";
```
Simplest form with literal condition and string values.

### Direct Output Pattern
```typescript
console.log(result);
```
Outputs ternary result without additional formatting.

### Minimal Test Case Pattern
Uses absolute minimum code to test a single feature in isolation.

### Literal Condition Pattern
Uses `true` as condition to ensure predictable result ("yes").

This minimal test validates:
1. Ternary operator syntax is recognized
2. Condition evaluation works
3. Correct branch is selected
4. Result can be stored in variable
5. Basic operator functionality works before complex tests
