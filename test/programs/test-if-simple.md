# CVM Simple If Statement Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program is a minimal test case for if/else conditional statements in the CVM. It validates that basic conditional branching works correctly with simple comparison operators. The test uses a hardcoded value to ensure predictable results and tests both single if statements and if-else combinations.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### Conditional Statements
- **Single if statement**: Tests condition without else branch
- **If-else statement**: Tests two-way branching
- Uses comparison operators (> and <)

### Test Structure
- Uses constant value (10) for predictable testing
- Tests both true and false conditions
- Provides clear output for verification

### Comparison Operations
- Greater than (>) operator
- Less than (<) operator
- Demonstrates correct boolean evaluation

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Single If Pattern
```typescript
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
```
Simplest form of conditional execution - code runs only when condition is true.

### If-Else Pattern
```typescript
if (x < 5) {
    console.log("x is less than 5");
} else {
    console.log("x is NOT less than 5");
}
```
Two-way branching ensuring one path always executes.

### Test Value Pattern
```typescript
const x = 10;
console.log("x is: " + x);
```
Uses a constant test value with output for transparency.

### Verification Output Pattern
Each conditional includes descriptive output to verify which branch executed, making test results immediately clear.

### Test Boundary Pattern
The value 10 is chosen to:
- Be clearly greater than 5 (first test passes)
- Be clearly not less than 5 (second test takes else branch)
- Avoid edge cases for initial testing

### Linear Test Flow Pattern
```typescript
console.log("Starting if test...");
// tests
console.log("If test complete!");
```
Clear start/end markers for test execution tracking.

This minimal test is essential because:
1. It validates the most basic conditional logic
2. It tests both single and two-branch conditionals
3. It provides a foundation for more complex control flow tests
4. It can quickly identify fundamental issues with if/else implementation
