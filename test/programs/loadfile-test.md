# loadfile-test.ts Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary
This is a simple test program designed to verify the CVM's file loading capabilities. It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and console output functionality.

## 2. Key Functions/Features
- **main()**: The entry point function that:
  - Prints a greeting message
  - Performs basic arithmetic (42 + 8)
  - Outputs the calculation result (50)
  - Returns the computed value

## 3. Code Patterns Used
- **Simple function declaration**: Uses a straightforward function definition
- **Variable assignment**: Demonstrates basic variable declaration and assignment
- **String concatenation**: Uses the + operator for string concatenation in console.log
- **Return value**: Returns a numeric result from the main function
- **Sequential execution**: Shows linear program flow without control structures

This file serves as a minimal example for testing the CVM's ability to load and execute external TypeScript files.
