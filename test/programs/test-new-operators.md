# CVM New Operators Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program comprehensively tests newly implemented operators in the CVM including modulo (%), comparison operators (<=, >=), and strict equality operators (===, !==). It validates each operator through various scenarios including basic operations, user input integration, loop usage, type comparisons, and practical applications like grade calculation and array processing.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### Arithmetic Operators
- **Modulo operator (%)**: Tests remainder calculation with both hardcoded and user input values
- Shows practical use in checking divisibility

### Comparison Operators
- **Less than or equal (<=)**: Tests with equal and unequal values
- **Greater than or equal (>=)**: Validates inclusive comparisons
- Integration with while loops for iteration control

### Strict Equality Operators
- **Strict equality (===)**: No type coercion comparison
- **Strict inequality (!==)**: Type-sensitive not-equal comparison
- Comparison with loose equality (==) to show differences

### Integration Features
- Grade calculation system using new comparison operators
- Array processing with conditional counting
- Complex expressions combining multiple operators
- Interactive testing with CC inputs

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Operator Validation Pattern
```typescript
const remainder = a % b;
console.log("17 % 5 = " + remainder);
if (remainder === 2) {
    console.log("✓ Modulo works correctly");
}
```
Tests operator and immediately validates result.

### Interactive Testing Pattern
```typescript
const dividend = CC("Enter a number to divide:");
const divisor = CC("Enter divisor:");
const mod = dividend % divisor;
```
Uses CC inputs to test operators with dynamic values.

### Comparison Testing Pattern
```typescript
if (x <= y) {
    console.log("✓ 10 <= 10 is true");
}
```
Tests boundary conditions for comparison operators.

### Loop Integration Pattern
```typescript
let i = 0;
while (i <= 3) {
    console.log("  i = " + i);
    i = i + 1;
}
```
Shows <= operator controlling loop iterations.

### Type Comparison Pattern
```typescript
if (num == str) {
    console.log("✓ 5 == '5' is true (type coercion)");
}
if (!(num === str)) {
    console.log("✓ 5 === '5' is false (no type coercion)");
}
```
Contrasts loose and strict equality behaviors.

### Null Comparison Pattern
```typescript
if (nullVal !== zero) {
    console.log("✓ null !== 0 is true");
}
```
Tests edge cases with null values.

### Grade Calculation Pattern
```typescript
if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("Grade: B");
}
```
Practical application of >= operator in cascading conditions.

### Divisibility Check Pattern
```typescript
if (score % 10 === 0) {
    console.log("Score is a multiple of 10!");
}
```
Combines modulo with strict equality for divisibility testing.

### Array Processing Pattern
```typescript
while (idx < numbers.length) {
    if (numbers[idx] >= 25) {
        count = count + 1;
    }
    sum = sum + numbers[idx];
    idx = idx + 1;
}
```
Uses new operators for filtering and aggregation.

### Verification Checklist Pattern
```typescript
console.log("✓ Modulo (%)");
console.log("✓ Less than or equal (<=)");
```
Provides systematic confirmation of all tested features.

This comprehensive test ensures:
1. All new operators function correctly
2. Operators work with various data types
3. Integration with existing features (loops, arrays, CC)
4. Type-sensitive comparisons work as expected
5. Practical applications demonstrate real-world usage
