# CVM Array Index Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program is a minimal test case designed to validate basic array indexing functionality in the CVM (Cognitive Virtual Machine). It tests both direct (literal) array index access and variable-based index access to ensure that the CVM correctly handles array element retrieval using different indexing methods.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### Array Creation
- Creates a simple array with three numeric elements: [10, 20, 30]

### Direct Index Access
- Tests accessing array elements using literal numeric indices (0, 1, 2)
- Validates that arr[0], arr[1], and arr[2] return the correct values

### Variable-Based Index Access
- Tests accessing array elements using a variable as the index
- Demonstrates dynamic index manipulation by changing the variable value
- Ensures the CVM correctly resolves variable references in array index expressions

### Output Verification
- Uses console.log statements to output values for manual verification
- Provides clear section headers to distinguish between test types

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Test Case Structure Pattern
```typescript
console.log("Test description");
// test code
console.log("Section header:");
// section tests
```
Organizes tests with descriptive headers for easy result interpretation.

### Direct Access Pattern
```typescript
console.log(arr[0]);
console.log(arr[1]);
console.log(arr[2]);
```
Tests the most basic form of array access with hardcoded indices.

### Variable Index Pattern
```typescript
let i = 0;
console.log(arr[i]);
i = 1;
console.log(arr[i]);
```
Demonstrates that array indices can be computed from variables, testing the CVM's ability to evaluate expressions in index positions.

### Sequential Testing Pattern
The program tests each array element in sequence (0, 1, 2) for both access methods, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all array positions.

### Minimal Test Pattern
This is a focused unit test that isolates a single feature (array indexing) without dependencies on other CVM features, making it ideal for early-stage testing or debugging array access issues.
