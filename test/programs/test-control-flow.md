# CVM Control Flow Test Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary

This TypeScript program is a focused test suite for control flow features in the CVM (Cognitive Virtual Machine). It validates the implementation of conditional statements (if/else) and loop structures (while), including nested conditions and complex expressions. The test uses interactive user input via CC (Cognitive Calls) to demonstrate dynamic control flow based on runtime values.

## 2. Key Functions/Features

### Conditional Statements
- **Simple if-else**: Age-based categorization (minor/adult)
- **Nested if-else chains**: Multi-level grade calculation system
- **Complex conditions**: Arithmetic expressions in conditions
- **Nested conditions within branches**: Secondary comparisons after primary conditions

### Loop Structures
- **While loop**: Countdown implementation with decrementing counter
- **Loop termination**: Condition-based loop exit

### User Interaction
- Multiple CC inputs for dynamic testing
- Numeric input processing for calculations
- Real-time decision making based on user input

### Expression Evaluation
- Arithmetic operations within conditions: (x + y) > 10
- Comparison operators in various contexts
- Variable manipulation within loops

## 3. Code Patterns Used

### Simple Branching Pattern
```typescript
if (age < 18) {
    console.log("You are a minor");
} else {
    console.log("You are an adult");
}
```
Basic two-way decision making based on a single condition.

### Cascading Grade Pattern
```typescript
if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else {
    if (score >= 80) {
        console.log("Grade: B");
    } else {
        // more nested conditions
    }
}
```
Implements grade thresholds using nested if-else statements, checking from highest to lowest.

### Countdown Loop Pattern
```typescript
let count = 5;
while (count > 0) {
    console.log("Count: " + count);
    count = count - 1;
}
```
Classic countdown pattern with loop variable decrement.

### Complex Condition Pattern
```typescript
if ((x + y) > 10) {
    // primary action
    if (x > y) {
        // secondary decision
    }
}
```
Demonstrates expression evaluation in conditions and nested decision-making within branches.

### Interactive Testing Pattern
```typescript
const score = CC("Enter your test score (0-100):");
if (score >= 90) {
    // process score
}
```
Uses CC to get runtime values for testing various control flow paths.

### Status Message Pattern
The program provides clear feedback for each control flow decision, making it easy to verify correct branching behavior.

### Test Organization Pattern
Each control flow feature is tested independently with descriptive comments, making the test suite modular and easy to understand.
