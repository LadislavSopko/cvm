# Simple ForEach Analysis

## 1. Purpose Summary
This program tests the CVM's implementation of the for-of loop construct in TypeScript. It verifies that the VM can properly iterate over array literals and handle const declarations within loop scopes.

## 2. Key Functions/Features
- **main()**: Primary function that demonstrates for-of loop functionality
  - Logs a pre-loop message
  - Iterates over an array literal [1, 2, 3]
  - Logs each array element with a descriptive prefix
  - Logs a post-loop message
- **Self-invocation**: The program immediately calls main() after definition

## 3. Code Patterns Used
- **For-of Loop**: Uses modern ES6+ iteration syntax to loop through array elements
- **Const Declaration in Loop**: Demonstrates proper scoping with `const x` in the loop header
- **Array Literal**: Uses inline array literal [1, 2, 3] directly in the loop
- **String Concatenation**: Combines static text with dynamic values for output
- **Sequential Logging**: Shows control flow with before/during/after loop messages
- **Immediate Execution**: Function is both defined and called in the same file
