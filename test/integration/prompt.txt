Based on the analysis, I need to think deeply about the VM refactoring strategy. The monolithic 1000+ line switch statement is our biggest maintainability issue. 

Current situation:
- Single execute() method with massive switch statement
- Over 50 opcodes handled in one place
- Stack manipulation logic repeated for each opcode
- Error handling duplicated across opcodes

I need to design a clean, modular architecture that:
1. Separates each opcode into its own handler
2. Provides consistent error handling
3. Makes testing individual opcodes easy
4. Maintains performance (we're in a tight execution loop)
5. Preserves the current VM state management

Key questions:
- Should handlers be pure functions or methods?
- How to handle stack underflow/overflow checks efficiently?
- Should we use a dispatch table or class-based handlers?
- How to maintain the pc (program counter) updates consistently?
- What's the best way to handle opcodes that change control flow (JUMP, JUMP_IF_FALSE)?
