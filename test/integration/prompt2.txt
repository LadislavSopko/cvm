I need to synthesize the VM refactoring recommendations and make a final decision. Let me analyze:

## Current Analysis Summary:

1. **Main Issue**: 1000+ line switch statement in VM execute() method
2. **Two Proposed Patterns**:
   - Pattern A: Functional dispatch table (array of functions)
   - Pattern B: Class-based handlers (Command pattern)

## Performance Research Results:
- V8 optimizes both patterns well through inline caching
- Key is type consistency, not syntax choice
- Function calls in V8 6.0+ have some overhead, but well-optimized for hot paths
- TypeScript helps by enforcing consistent types

## My Additional Considerations:

1. **CVM's Current Architecture**:
   - Already uses visitor pattern in compiler successfully
   - Has clear separation of concerns
   - Tests are comprehensive (524 passing)

2. **Maintenance Patterns**:
   - We just removed 670 lines of duplicate code
   - Goal is long-term maintainability
   - Need to support ~50 opcodes

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Need to test individual opcodes in isolation
   - Stack effects should be verifiable
   - Error cases need coverage

## Critical Evaluation:

**Pattern A (Functional) Pros**:
- Simpler, less boilerplate
- Direct array indexing is fastest
- Easier to understand initially

**Pattern A Cons**:
- Metadata (stack effects) separated from logic
- Testing requires more setup
- All handlers in one file becomes unwieldy

**Pattern B (Class-based) Pros**:
- Excellent organization (one file per opcode)
- Metadata colocated with logic
- Easy to test in isolation
- Follows SOLID principles

**Pattern B Cons**:
- More files/boilerplate
- Slight performance overhead (negligible per research)

What's your recommendation considering CVM's specific context and goals?
