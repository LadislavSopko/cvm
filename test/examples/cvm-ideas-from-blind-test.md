# CVM Ideas from Blind Test

These ideas came from Claude after experiencing CVM for the first time without any prior context.

## 1. Error Recovery & Checkpointing
- What if CC() responses fail validation? Could have retry logic or alternative prompts
- Checkpoint system: save execution state at key points, allow resume from crashes
- "Undo" mechanism for when Claude gives a wrong answer

## 2. Parallel Task Execution
- Multiple CC() calls could be batched: `CC.batch([prompt1, prompt2, prompt3])`
- Claude could work on multiple independent branches simultaneously
- Would need dependency tracking between tasks

## 3. Task Prioritization & Hints
- CC() could accept hints: `CC("Summarize this", { expectedLength: "short", format: "bullet-points" })`
- Priority levels for tasks when multiple are pending
- Time estimates for better workflow planning

## 4. Debugging & Introspection
- Step-through debugger for CVM programs
- Ability to inspect variable state at any point
- Replay executions with different CC() responses

## 5. Pattern Library
- Common patterns like map/reduce over files with CC()
- Built-in retry/validation patterns
- Template system for common workflows

## 6. Context Management
- CC() could include relevant variables automatically: `CC.withContext("Process this item", {item, previousResults})`
- Smart context trimming for long-running programs
- Option to preserve certain outputs across CC() calls

## Core Insight
The core insight from using it: CVM makes Claude work like a focused employee who gets one clear task at a time instead of trying to juggle everything. That's powerful!
